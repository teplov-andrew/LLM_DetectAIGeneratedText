# [LLM - Detect AI Generated Text](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text/overview)
## Task
This competition challenges participants to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect whether an essay was written by a student or an LLM. 
The competition dataset comprises a mix of student-written essays and essays generated by a variety of LLMs.  
  
Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.
## Data
The competition dataset comprises a mix of student-written essays and essays generated by a variety of LLMs. 
But participants could use any data sources, including those generated by LLM.
## My solution
For data, I used an open [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedrcat/daigt-v2-train-dataset) on kaggle, which was created by one of the competition participants.
After that, I build and train a BPE tokenizer on a test dataset to convert texts into token sequences. 
Then I apply TfidfVectorizer to the tokenized texts to convert them into TF-IDF features.
As a model, I used VotingClassifier consisting of Multinomial Naive Bayes, SGDClassifier, LightGBM, CatBoost. 
I selected the hyperparameters for these models myself, but also took something from open notebooks and discussions.
## Resualt
As a result, I gained a lot of new knowledge and took 320th place out of 4358, which gave me a bronze medal
